Nowadays, everyone invests. Whether it is for fun or for a job, who would not want to passively make some money? Let us help you choose where to dump your money into!

About 55% of the American population owns some form of stock. With more and more people starting to invest everyday, we at rocketStonks aim to create a platform where one can monitor stocks from varying categories to determine whether or not they should invest. We seek to do this by providing stocks of differing industries and charts to illustrate the history of their growth. We hope that these resources will encourage more people to take advantage of this captialist economy and make their own gains from it!

Our website features stocks from categories ranging from Technology to Cryptocurrency and even includes Penny Stocks. Interested in one category? Use the drop down menu to learn more about that industry and some of our picks of which companies we think you should follow. Our website should make it seamless for the average small time investor to buy high and sell low!

We hope our website proves to be a valuable resource for those who wish to do their due dilligence.
